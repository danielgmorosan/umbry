# Umbry

**A private, decentralized team workspace — Slack/Discord, but the messages are actually private, the AI runs on your own hardware, and there's no vendor server that can be subpoenaed, breached, or shut off.**

## What is this?

Umbry takes [Gossip's](https://github.com/massalabs/gossip) consumer end-to-end-encrypted messenger — pseudonymous identity (a passphrase, no PII), post-quantum encryption, no central server — and turns it into a **team-collaboration product**: channels, direct messages, voice/video calls, file sharing, and a workspace AI assistant.

The pitch, in one line: **Slack where DMs are provably private, the AI runs on your own machine, and you can self-host the whole thing.**

- 🔒 **DMs are end-to-end encrypted** — reused verbatim from Gossip's 1:1 channel. No server (ours or yours) can read them.
- 💬 **Channels that just work** — public, private, and password-protected, with threads, mentions, edits, reactions, and voice messages.
- 📞 **Calls & huddles** — voice/video/screen-share, per channel or DM, via [LiveKit](https://livekit.io).
- 🤖 **A workspace AI** — recaps and Q&A over the channels you can access, running on a **local open-source model** by default (cloud optional). It can never see your DMs.
- 🖥️ **Native desktop app** — Windows, macOS, and Linux installers, built and published from CI.
- 🏠 **Self-hostable** — run the relay, AI, and calls on your own hardware (in progress — see the roadmap).

> **Identity = a recovery passphrase.** No email, no phone number, no account with us. Your keys are derived from the passphrase and never leave your device.

## Download

Grab the desktop app from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/danielgmorosan/umbry/releases/latest):

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Windows | `Umbry.Setup.*.exe` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `Umbry-*-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `Umbry-*.dmg` |
| Linux | `Umbry-*.AppImage` |

The builds are currently **unsigned**, so on first launch: Windows → SmartScreen → *More info → Run anyway*; macOS → right-click the app → *Open*.

Prefer the browser? The app also runs at **[umbry.chat](https://umbry.chat)**.

## How it works today (the centralized setup)

Two independent transport paths, chosen per privacy level:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph client["Client — web (Vercel) or desktop (Electron)"]
        UI["React app"]
    end

    UI -- "DMs (E2EE)" --> SDK["gossip-sdk<br/>(post-quantum, WASM)"]
    SDK -- "encrypted" --> Massa["Massa network<br/>(decentralized, no central server)"]

    UI -- "channels · calls · AI · files" --> Relay["Relay (Fly.io)<br/>services/relay"]
    Relay --> LK["LiveKit<br/>(calls)"]
    Relay --> AI["Ollama<br/>(local AI model)"]
    Relay --> Store["Channel history<br/>+ uploads"]

    classDef e2ee fill:#0f5132,stroke:#1a7f4b,color:#eaffea;
    classDef conf fill:#2b2f36,stroke:#4b5563,color:#e5e7eb;
    class SDK,Massa e2ee;
    class Relay,LK,AI,Store conf;
```

- **Direct messages** ride Gossip's decentralized, end-to-end-encrypted 1:1 channel over the Massa network. There is **no server of ours in the path** — not even to relay them.
- **Everything else** (channels, calls, AI, file uploads) goes through a single lightweight **relay** ([`services/relay`](services/relay), a ~1.5k-line Node service on Fly.io). Channel contents are TLS-encrypted in transit and treated as **"workspace-confidential"** — readable by whoever runs the relay, but not end-to-end encrypted *yet* (group E2EE via MLS is on the roadmap). We label this honestly in the UI.
- **The web app** is a static React build on Vercel; **calls** use LiveKit; the **AI** runs on a local open-source model (Ollama) and only ever sees channel content the requester can already access.

### Security model

The relay used to trust whatever `userId` a client claimed. It no longer does:

- **Proven identity.** Every client derives a dedicated Ed25519 key from its recovery passphrase (portable across devices, separate from the post-quantum identity keys). On connect it signs a server challenge; the relay verifies it and **pins the key to the userId** — so nobody can impersonate anyone, read a private channel they're not in, or use a role they don't have.
- **Enforced everywhere.** Privileged actions over the WebSocket, and the AI / call-token / upload HTTP endpoints, all require the proven identity. AI recaps are scoped to the requester's actual channel membership.
- **Locked down.** Per-IP rate limits, a per-socket message cap, and a CORS/WebSocket origin allowlist.

Full write-up in [`docs/INTEGRATION-PLAN.md`](docs/INTEGRATION-PLAN.md).

## The road to fully self-hostable

The endgame is that **you** run the parts that hold your data. Because everything is URL-configured and the relay already fronts calls + AI + channels, this reduces to *which services the client talks to*. Three modes:

| Mode | Who runs it | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Managed** *(today)* | Us (Vercel + Fly) | Zero setup — open the app and talk. DMs still E2EE; channels/AI on our infra. |
| **B — Org self-host** *(planned)* | Your team, on one server | `docker compose up` — relay + LiveKit + Ollama + auto-TLS. Invite links point clients at it. Nothing touches us. |
| **C — Fully-local desktop** *(in progress)* | You, on your machine | One toggle in the desktop app spins up a bundled relay, a local LiveKit, and one-click Ollama. Everything runs on your GPU. |

**Progress:**
- ✅ **Hardened desktop shell + cross-platform installers** (this repo's `apps/desktop`, built via CI).
- ✅ **Relay authentication & enforcement** (the security model above) — the prerequisite for safely exposing a self-hosted relay.
- 🔜 **The self-host toggle** — bundle the local services and a Settings switch to flip everything to "run it yourself."

## Features

```

## Local development

Requires **Node ≥ 20** and **pnpm** (`corepack enable` picks up the pinned version).

```bash
# clone with the gossip submodule (provides gossip-sdk)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/danielgmorosan/umbry
cd umbry
pnpm install

cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env       # frontend config (no secrets)

# terminal 1 — the relay (channels, calls, AI, uploads) on :8788
cd services/relay && cp .env.example .env && node server.mjs

# terminal 2 — the web app on http://localhost:5173 (Vite proxies to the relay)
pnpm --filter @umbry/web dev
```

Run the desktop shell against your local web server:

```bash
UMBRY_DESKTOP_URL=http://localhost:5173 pnpm --filter @umbry/desktop dev
```

Other tasks: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`. Full end-to-end DMs additionally need Gossip's WASM crypto built inside the submodule (`vendor/gossip` → `npm run setup && npm run wasm:build`) — see [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md).

## Cutting a desktop release

Push a `desktop-v*` tag; CI builds Windows/macOS/Linux installers and publishes them to a GitHub Release:

```bash
git tag desktop-v0.1.1 && git push origin desktop-v0.1.1
```
